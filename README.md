# Evo: Natural Selection Simulator

Evo is a small  natural selection simulation program written in Rust . It offers a platform to explore the fascinating dynamics of evolution in a simulated environment.

## About

- **Natural Selection Simulation**: Visualize natural selection in a dynamic, simulated ecosystem.

- **Inspiration**: Built upon the concepts presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&t=2575s)

- **Graphics**: using SDL2 for graphics . (Currently working on porting graphics to Bevy.)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/evo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd evo
   ```

3. Build the project using Cargo
