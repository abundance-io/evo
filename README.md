Sure, here's an improved version of your README for your natural selection simulator:

# Evo: Natural Selection Simulator

Evo is a small  natural selection simulation program written in Rust . It offers a platform to explore the fascinating dynamics of evolution in a simulated environment.

## Features

- **Natural Selection Simulation**: Witness the process of natural selection unfold in a dynamic, simulated ecosystem.
  
- **Rust Implementation**: Developed entirely in Rust, Evo leverages the language's performance and safety features to provide a robust simulation environment.

- **Inspiration**: Built upon the concepts presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&t=2575s), Evo aims to bring academic research on evolution and natural selection to life in an interactive and accessible way.

- **Graphics Support**: currently using SDL2 for graphics . (Currently working on porting graphics to Bevy.)

## Getting Started

To start using Evo(when it's eventually working), follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/evo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd evo
   ```

3. Build the project using Cargo 
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. Run the simulation.
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
